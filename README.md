# Human and Computer Course, Class A, Informatics batch 2025 Attendance Visualizer

This project consists of two Python scripts for managing and visualizing student attendance data from the *Human-Computer Interaction* (HCI) course.

## Overview

The project includes:

1. **attendance.py**  
   Generates a CSV file (`attendance_data.csv`) that contains weekly attendance data.

2. **attendance_visualizer.py**  
   Reads the CSV file and creates a bar chart showing the number of students present and absent each week.

```
